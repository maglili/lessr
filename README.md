# LESSR

A PyTorch implementation of LESSR (**L**ossless **E**dge-order preserving aggregation and **S**hortcut graph attention for **S**ession-based **R**ecommendation) from the paper:  
_Handling Information Loss of Graph Neural Networks for Session-based Recommendation, Tianwen Chen and Raymong Chi-Wing Wong, KDD '20_

## Requirements

- PyTorch 1.6.0
- NumPy 1.19.1
- Pandas 1.1.3
- DGL 0.5.2

## Usage

1. Install the requirements.  
    If you use Anaconda, you can create a conda environment with the required packages using the following command.

    ```sh
    conda env create -f packages.yml
    ```

    Activate the created conda environment.

    ```
    conda activate lessr
    ```

2. Download and extract the datasets.
    - [Diginetica](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/11161)
    - [Gowalla](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/loc-Gowalla.html)
    - [Last.fm](http://ocelma.net/MusicRecommendationDataset/lastfm-1K.html)

3. Preprocess the datasets using [preprocess.py](preprocess.py).  
    For example, to preprocess the *Diginetica* dataset, extract the file *train-item-views.csv* to the folder `datasets/` and run the following command:

    ```sh
    python preprocess.py -d diginetica -f datasets/train-item-views.csv
    ```

    The preprocessed dataset is stored in the folder `datasets/diginetica`.  
    You can see the detailed usage of `preprocess.py` by running the following command:

    ```sh
    python preprocess.py -h
    ```

4. Train the model using [main.py](main.py).  
    If no arguments are passed to `main.py`, it will train a model using a sample dataset with default hyperparameters.

    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

    The commands to train LESSR with suggested hyperparameters on different datasets are as follows:

    ```sh
    python main.py --dataset-dir datasets/diginetica --embedding-dim 32 --num-layers 4
    python main.py --dataset-dir datasets/gowalla --embedding-dim 64 --num-layers 4
    python main.py --dataset-dir datasets/lastfm --embedding-dim 128 --num-layers 4
    ```

    You can see the detailed usage of `main.py` by running the following command:

    ```sh
    python main.py -h
    ```

5. Use your own dataset.
    1. Create a subfolder in the `datasets/` folder.
    2. The subfolder should contain the following 3 files.
        - `num_items.txt`: This file contains a single integer which is the number of items in the dataset.
        - `train.txt`: This file contains all the training sessions.
        - `test.txt`: This file contains all the test sessions.
    3. Each line of `train.txt` and `test.txt` represents a session, which is a list of item IDs separated by commas. Note the item IDs must be in the range of `[0, num_items)`.
    4. See the folder [datasets/sample](datasets/sample) for an example of a dataset.
